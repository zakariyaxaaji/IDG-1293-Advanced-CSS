Project Description:       
      In this project we will create a single page application with a poem of our choosing where we will try to animate the text and background. The goal of our animations will be to amplify the meaning behind the poem.

Seperation of concerns:   
     Our files will be seperated into different folders to make it easier to handle different aspects of the solution. We have a folder for images, styles, and js. The different part of the styling files will have the naming scheme __nameOfYourConcern.scss and the rest of the files will use the BEM naming conventions.
