project discription:       
      In this project we will create a single page application with a poem of our choosing where we will try to animate the text. Our animations goals is to amplify the text message.

seperation of concerns:   
     Our files will be seperated into diffrent folders to make it easier to handle different aspects of the solution. We have a folder for images, styles, and js. the different part of the styling files will have the naming scheme __nameOfYourConcern.scss and the rest of the files will use the BEM naming conventions.
