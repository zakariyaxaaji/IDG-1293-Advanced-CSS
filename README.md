Project Description:       
      In this project we will create a single page application with a poem of our choosing where we will try to animate the text and background. The goal of our animations will be to amplify the meaning behind the poem.

Seperation of concerns:   
     Our files will be seperated into different folders to make it easier to handle different aspects of the solution. We have a folder for images, styles, and js. The different part of the styling files will have the naming scheme __nameOfYourConcern.scss and the rest of the files will use the BEM naming conventions.




BEM 
In the SCSS file, we used the common naming conventions of BEM For classes. Blocks in our code are given a normal class => .block and the children of that block will inherit its name with __ => .block__name of the element. In the instances where we used modifiers the names will be => .block__element--modifier.
